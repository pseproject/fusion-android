# Ubiq Fusion for Android

Currently, this project is under heavy development. Originally started as a fork of Lunary Ethereum Wallet (but is moving towards to its own codebase merging
 features and ideas also found on [Walleth](https://github.com/walleth/walleth) project).

Right now, we are working on:

* Porting to Kotlin (some code is ported with Intellij Studio with direct conversion, so maybe the code is not the most idiomatic one, eventually it will
change)
* Adding support for MVVM (with RxJava2, LiveData, Room, Kodein and those kind of goodies)
* Brand new design

As Lunary, this project will support the following features:

## Features
* Mutli wallet support  
* Support for Watch only wallets  
* Send / Request payments  
* Token Balances  
* Notification on incoming transactions  
* Combined transaction history  
* Addressbook and eth_address_view naming
* Importing / Exporting wallets  
* Display amounts and token in ETH, USD or BTC  
* No registration or sign up required  
* Price history charts  
* Fingerprint / Password protection
* Supporting 8 Currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, AUD, CAD, JPY, RUB
